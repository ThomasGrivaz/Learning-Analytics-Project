14-15 november:

Extract some simple features from the dataset:
- number of videos watched since last submission
- number of comments made
- number of video to forum transitions?


N gram pairs
problem with simple n gram - want to capture higher-level behvaior
- i.e. user watches video, posts on forum, resubmits.

Thomas working on feature that requires figuring out what happened on the forum
not just if somebody made a post
see which user created the post (PostID)

for each feature

plot distribution of each feature
Cohen's kappa < 0.6 signals poor interjudge agreement

Nov29 Mina update
We are using a new train and test dataset.pickle - replaced with updated version in repo
dataset_test.pickle same as kaggle
instead of classifier.startingPoint.R:
    use classifierCompleteFlow, which has the whole pipeline for kaggle classification competition

instead of kappa value, we're using ROC as the evaluation metric

random classifier has AUC of 0.5
ours would be between 0.5 and 1

After visualization of the dataset in R (View(db)), I observed that the features we added are typically very sparse:

-349 non zero values for NumberoOfThreadCreated (out of 4948 observations)
-83 non zero values for NumberOfUpvotes
-761 for NumberOfPosts
-215 for NumberOfComments
-822 for NumberVideoWatched
-402 for NumberOfSeekEvents

Hence I doubt that these features will have a predictive impact on the classification task

Possible solutions: 
-find a smart way to aggregate these features (maybe build some kind of  implication score given all these numbers)
-explore other features

I started trying a few models
-Random Forest gives poor performance (ROC of 0.545) no matter which set of features you choose. Oddly enough the best performance is for only one predictor. I will further investigate

-SVM yields poor results as well. I did not try different kernels for now

model that can learn from chronological data
(split by 

how to model consistency?

for regression?
could measure forum/video activity of user compared to others (i.e. userX is in 95th percentile of forum users)

December 13 notes
trying different models has not improved anything

simple features

numSlowPlays - check distribution, seek type not valid/missing

best submission - basic features timesincelast, numvideoevents, ...
some had success with knn
once you train the model

For the report

Features:

stats:
forum usage
distribution of # of submissions

TODO ipynb w descriptive stats of features

Time spent on forum  / Time between submissions
2 hours on forum, 3 days between submission
is worse than
30 minutes on forum, 1 hour

*** Another one ***
DELTA time of submission - time of last forum event


OBservations when splitting the data in two
TimeSinceLast is lower for the "improved" submissions
