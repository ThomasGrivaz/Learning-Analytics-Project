14-15 november:

Extract some simple features from the dataset:
- number of videos watched since last submission
- number of comments made
- number of video to forum transitions?


N gram pairs
problem with simple n gram - want to capture higher-level behvaior
- i.e. user watches video, posts on forum, resubmits.

Thomas working on feature that requires figuring out what happened on the forum
not just if somebody made a post
see which user created the post (PostID)

Nov29 Mina update
We are using a new train and test dataset.pickle - replaced with updated version in repo
dataset_test.pickle same as kaggle
instead of classifier.startingPoint.R:
    use classifierCompleteFlow, which has the whole pipeline for kaggle classification competition

instead of kappa value, we're using ROC as the evaluation metric

random classifier has AUC of 0.5
ours would be between 0.5 and 1
